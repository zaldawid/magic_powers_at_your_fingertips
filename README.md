# Debug me

This repository contains 6 targets that contain different bugs. They were originally created to accompany my talk given at ACCU 2024 titled *Magic powers at your fingertips--Boosting your developer's mojo with `gdb`*. They can be used to learn basic (`debug_me_01-03`), and advanced (`debug_me_04-06`) debugging techniques with `gdb`. See the `DESCRIPTION.md` files in the subdirectories for more info.
